## Performance checklist

When a page is slow, check these in order:

1. Network: Check if resources are large or slow to load (images, scripts, etc.)

- use `<link rel="preload">` for critical resources
- use `link rel="preconnect">` for third-party domains
- compress everything (gzip, brotli)
- cache with proper headers (Cache-Control, ETag)

2. Parsing: Is JS / CSS blocking rendering?

- CSS in `<head>` is render-blocking
- JS with defer / async
- Code splitting

3. Javascript execution

- check with Performance tab in DevTools
- break long tasks into smaller chunks
- use Web Workers for heavy computations
- debounce / throttle event handlers

4. DOM

- batch DOM reads / writes
- use `requestAnimationFrame` for visual updates
- use DocumentFragment for multiple DOM insertions
- avoid layout thrashing

5. Rendering

- animate only transform and opacity
- use `will-change` for elements that will be animated

## DevTools

- Performance tab -> record -> yellow bars (JS) and purple bars (rendering)
- Rendering tab -> Paint flashing (check repaints)
- Rendering tab -> Layout shift regions (check CLS)
- Layers tab -> check compositing layers and GPU usage
- Network tab -> check resource sizes and load times
